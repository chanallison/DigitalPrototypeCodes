# Pulse-Sensor-Codes
Allison's Codes for Pulse Sensors

1.) Arduino - reading 2 pulse sensors
For this project, I used the "TwoPulseSensors_On_OneArduino" file to get the two pulse sensors running on my Arduino. This file is from the Pulse Sensor Playground Library in Arduino. 

2.) Processing - visualizing 2 pulse sensors
I then sent the data from the pulse sensors in Arduino over to Processing useing the "PulseSensor_Processing_2_Sensors" file. This file is taken from https://github.com/WorldFamousElectronics/PulseSensorAmped_2_Sensors. 

3.) Processing - open sourced sketch from OpenProcessing
Then I used this this the code from this sketch: https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/625388 as a basis for my own visualization.

4.) Processing - my own sketch
Lastly, the "sketch_22_OuterSpaceP_B" file is the final visualization that I created.
